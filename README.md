[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg "PRs Welcome")](https://github.com/mehdichaouch/screen-cheat-sheet/pulls)

__Prerequisite__
- [WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org/)
- codebase in Bitbucket, for CVS part (sorry the WordPress I maintain is an old project 😃)

## What about

`wp-plugin-auto-update.sh` script allow to:
- automatically update WordPress plugins in mass;
- generate a branch for each plugins;
- generate a Pull/Merge Request for each plugins;
- give some nice output with lot of 🍺.

What it can't do yet:
- notify 🔔
- deploy 🚀

but if I found one day the time and a real necessity for those two features, for sure I'll do it, so stay tuned, Star ⭐ it or watch 👀.
